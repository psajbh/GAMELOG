flyway:
to execute flyway from scratch, you need to clean out the schema.
From mysql workbench execute the following:
	
	drop schema if exists gamelog;
	create schema if not exists gamelog;
	now you have a virgin schema.
	
	run goal: flyway:clean -e  profile: jbh
	          flyway:migrate -e profile: jbh
	          flyway:repair -e profile: jbh
